# AppCenterAuthDataSample
A sample app demonstrating App Center Auth and App Center Data, built for iOS and Android using Xamarin.Forms.

Just about every mobile app today uses a remote backend to store data. But creating a backend is hard - it requires extensive Database, API, Networking, Security, Authentication and Server knowledge. Luckily, App Center Data makes it easy to create a mobile backend with a few clicks and a couple lines of code.
